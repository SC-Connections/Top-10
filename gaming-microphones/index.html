  <ul>
    <li>[Natural Audio Clarity] Operated with frequency response of 50Hz-16KHz, the podcasting XLR mic delivers balanced audio range, likely to resonate with your audience. Directional cardioid dynamic microphone corded will not exaggerate your voice, while rejects unwanted off-axis noise for vocal originality and intelligibility during your PS5 gaming streaming video recording. (Tips: Keep the top of end-addressing XLR dynamic microphone AM8 facing audio source, and suggested recording range is 2 to 6 in.)</li>
    <li>[XLR Connection Upgrade-Ability] To use XLR connection, connect the podcast microphone to an audio interface (or mixer) using a separate XLR cable (NOT Included) . Well-connected and smooth operation improves audio flexibility to make you explore various types of music recording singing. The streaming mic isolates the pristine and accurate sound from ambient noise with greater no interference and fidelity. (RGB and function key on mic are INACTIVE when using XLR connection.)</li>
    <li>[USB Connection with Handy Mute] Skip the hassle of setting something up and plug the cable to play the dynamic USB microphone directly, which suits for beginner creators or daily podcast. You can quickly control the gamer mic with tap-to-mute that is independent of computer/Macbook programs to keep privacy when live streaming. LED mute reminder helps you get rid of forgetting to cancel the mute. (RGB and function key are only available for USB connection, but NOT for XLR connection)</li>
