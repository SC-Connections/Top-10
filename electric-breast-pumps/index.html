            <ul>
                <li>Hospital-grade Suction: The max suction value reaches to 338mmHg, which ensures pretty decent output. Note: Please reach your Maximum Comfort Vaccum for more milk. You can switch to a suitable suction level based on the usual breast milk output and pain tolerance.</li>
                    <li>Upgraded Mode Choice: It has 4 modes and 9 suction levels and naturally mimics your little one&#039;s feeding. The LED screen clearly displays the suction mode, suction level, and battery level. The &quot;dual-frequency&quot; mode helps inverted and flat nipples to pump smoothly.</li>
                    <li>More Sizes for Most Moms: The set includes flange inserts for sizes 19mm, 21mm, and 24mm. The pump itself is 28mm. Note: Moms can find the appropriate flange size by the &quot;measure card&quot; in the package.</li>
                    <li>More Hidden &amp; Comfortable: The wearable breast pump is unnoticed in the bra. It is only 240g, not bulky at all. That gives moms all-around comfort. Smaller Size, Stronger Suction!</li>
                    <li>Safe Enough: Made of BPA-free food-grade silicone, safe for both moms and babies. The anti-backflow design and sealing system prevents breast milk from leakage. The capacity is up to 150ml/5oz, and the optimal collection volume is 120ml/4oz</li>

                <h2>Buyer's Guide: How to Choose the Best Electric Breast Pumps</h2>
                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>Choosing the right electric breast pumps requires careful consideration of several key factors. 
        This guide will help you understand what to look for to ensure you make the best purchase for your needs.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Factors to Consider</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quality and Durability:</strong> Look for well-built products with quality materials that will last</li>
            <li><strong>Price and Value:</strong> Consider the overall value, not just the lowest price</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Reviews:</strong> Check ratings and reviews from verified purchasers</li>
            <li><strong>Brand Reputation:</strong> Choose reputable brands with good customer support</li>
            <li><strong>Warranty and Support:</strong> Ensure adequate warranty coverage and customer service</li>

        <p>The electric breast pumps market offers options at various price points. Premium models typically range 
        from $100-$500+ and offer advanced features, superior build quality, and better performance. Mid-range options 
        ($50-$100) provide excellent value, balancing quality and affordability. Budget-friendly choices (under $50) 
        can still deliver good performance for casual users.</p>
        
        <h3>Brand Reputation</h3>
        <p>Established brands often provide better customer support, warranty coverage, and product reliability. 
        However, newer brands can offer innovative features at competitive prices. Always check customer reviews 
        and ratings before making your final decision.</p>
        
        <h3>Making Your Final Decision</h3>
        <p>Consider your specific needs, budget, and intended use. Read customer reviews to understand real-world 
        performance. Check return policies and warranty terms. Compare multiple options from our top 10 list to 
        find the perfect match for your requirements.</p>
