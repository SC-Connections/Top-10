                <h2>Buyer's Guide: How to Choose the Best Space Heaters</h2>
                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>Choosing the right space heaters requires careful consideration of several key factors. 
        This guide will help you understand what to look for to ensure you make the best purchase for your needs.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Factors to Consider</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quality and Durability:</strong> Look for well-built products with quality materials that will last</li>
            <li><strong>Price and Value:</strong> Consider the overall value, not just the lowest price</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Reviews:</strong> Check ratings and reviews from verified purchasers</li>
            <li><strong>Brand Reputation:</strong> Choose reputable brands with good customer support</li>
            <li><strong>Warranty and Support:</strong> Ensure adequate warranty coverage and customer service</li>

        <p>The space heaters market offers options at various price points. Premium models typically range 
        from $100-$500+ and offer advanced features, superior build quality, and better performance. Mid-range options

        can still deliver good performance for casual users.</p>
        
        <h3>Brand Reputation</h3>
        <p>Established brands often provide better customer support, warranty coverage, and product reliability. 
        However, newer brands can offer innovative features at competitive prices. Always check customer reviews 
        and ratings before making your final decision.</p>
        
        <h3>Making Your Final Decision</h3>
        <p>Consider your specific needs, budget, and intended use. Read customer reviews to understand real-world 
        performance. Check return policies and warranty terms. Compare multiple options from our top 10 list to
