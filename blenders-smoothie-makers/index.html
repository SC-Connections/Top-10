                <div class="guide-content">

            <li><strong>Quality and Durability:</strong> Look for well-built products with quality materials that will last</li>
            <li><strong>Price and Value:</strong> Consider the overall value, not just the lowest price</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Reviews:</strong> Check ratings and reviews from verified purchasers</li>
            <li><strong>Brand Reputation:</strong> Choose reputable brands with good customer support</li>
