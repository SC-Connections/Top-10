Compared to the single air inlet design, it can trap airborne pet hairs and odors more easily. This air purifier for large room can clean up to 2200 ft² per hour. WASHABLE FILTER: Equipped with a high-efficiency 3-stage filtration system, the air cleaner for pets can effectively filter airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns, such as pollen, dust, and pet dander. Cleaning the pre-filter with water or a vacuum cleaner will help extend the life of the filter. More activated carbon pellets help absorb a bad odor such as pet odors, fumes and VOCs. MULTI-FUNCTION & ENERGY-SAVING: The room air purifier has 4 adjustable fan speeds. You can choose the fan speed according to the air quality. The higher the wind speed, the faster the purification speed. You can also turn on the timer when you sleep or go out, which are 2/4/6/8h. Running at maximum wind speed for 24 hours only consumes 0.63 kW·h of electricity.",
