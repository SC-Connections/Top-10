                <h2>Buyer's Guide: How to Choose the Best Dog Beds</h2>
                <div class="guide-content">
                    <p>Choosing the right dog beds requires careful consideration of several key factors. 
        This guide will help you understand what to look for to ensure you make the best purchase for your needs.</p>

            <li><strong>Price and Value:</strong> Consider the overall value, not just the lowest price</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Reviews:</strong> Check ratings and reviews from verified purchasers</li>
            <li><strong>Brand Reputation:</strong> Choose reputable brands with good customer support</li>
