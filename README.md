## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm
- Puppeteer system dependencies (for scraping): libx11-xcb1, libxtst6, libxcomposite1, libxi6, libxrender1, libxrandr2

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SC-Connections/Top-10.git
cd Top-10
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables (optional for local testing):
```bash
export RAPIDAPI_KEY="your-rapidapi-key"
export AMAZON_AFFILIATE_ID="scconnec0d-20"
```

**Note**: The system now uses an **intelligent multi-source data layer** that gathers products from:
1. **Google Trends** (Puppeteer web scraping) - Shows market demand
2. **Amazon Best Sellers** (Puppeteer web scraping) - Shows proven sales
3. **Premium Brand Filtering** - Filters for high-value brands (Apple, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, etc.)
4. **RapidAPI Fallback** - Uses Amazon Real-Time API only when fewer than 8 products are found

This ensures sites are generated using real demand data and premium products for higher affiliate commissions.

4. Run the generator:
```bash
node site-generator.js
```

The generator will create sites in individual folders (e.g., `bluetooth-earbuds/`, `sleep-earbuds/`) in the repository root.

## 📝 Adding New Niches

Simply add new product categories to `niches.csv`:

```csv
Bluetooth Earbuds
Sleep Earbuds
Digital Cameras
Gaming Microphones
Student Laptops
Your New Niche Here
```

Each line should be a product category that people search for on Amazon.

## 🔧 Configuration

### GitHub Secrets

For the GitHub Actions workflow to fetch real Amazon data and generate sites, configure these secrets:

1. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `RAPIDAPI_KEY`: Your RapidAPI key for Amazon Real-Time API (https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/amazon-real-time-api)
   - `AMAZON_AFFILIATE_ID`: Your Amazon Associates affiliate ID

**Note**: The API host is hardcoded to `amazon-real-time-api.p.rapidapi.com` and Amazon domain is set to `US`. These values are not configurable via secrets.

### Workflow Configuration

The workflow runs:
- On push to `main` branch
- On manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
- Daily at 6 AM UTC (scheduled)

### Repository Architecture

All niche sites are hosted within this single repository:

- **Site paths**: `/{niche-slug}/` (e.g., `/bluetooth-earbuds/`, `/sleep-earbuds/`)
- **GitHub Pages URL**: `https://sc-connections.github.io/Top-10/{niche-slug}/`
- **Automatic deployment**: The `deploy-pages.yml` workflow deploys the entire repository to GitHub Pages
- **Site generation**: The `build-sites.yml` workflow generates sites and commits them back to the main branch

When the workflow runs:
1. Generates all niche sites locally in individual folders (e.g., `/bluetooth-earbuds/`)
2. For each niche:
   - Creates the site content (index.html, blog/, global.css, README.md)
   - Saves it in a folder named after the niche slug
3. Commits and pushes all generated folders back to the main branch
4. GitHub Pages automatically serves them at `https://sc-connections.github.io/Top-10/{slug}/`

## 🎨 Customization

### Templates

All templates are in the `templates/` directory:

- **template.html**: Main page structure
- **template.json**: Template configuration and placeholders
- **product-template.html**: Individual product card layout
- **blog-template.html**: Blog article page structure
- **global.css**: All styles (fully customizable)

### Intelligent Data Layer

The new multi-source data gathering system (`data-sources.js`) orchestrates product discovery:

**Priority Flow:**
1. **Google Trends** (`google-trends.js`) - Identifies trending products via Puppeteer scraping
2. **Amazon Best Sellers** (`amazon-scraper.js`) - Finds best-selling products via Puppeteer scraping
3. **Premium Brand Filter** - Filters products from premium brands:
   - Apple, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, Bang & Olufsen
   - Shure, Razer, Logitech, Samsung, JBL, Beats
4. **RapidAPI Fallback** (`api-fallback.js`) - Uses Amazon Real-Time API if < 8 premium products

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Real market demand data from Google Trends
- ✅ Proven sellers from Amazon rankings
- ✅ Premium brand focus = higher affiliate commissions
- ✅ Automatic fallback ensures consistent results

### SEO Content

The `generate-seo.js` module handles:
- Introduction paragraphs
- Buyer's guides
- FAQ sections
- Call-to-action text
- Structured data

Customize these functions to match your brand voice.

### Blog Content

The `generate-blog.js` module creates detailed product reviews. Modify the content generation functions to adjust:
- Article length
- Writing style
- Section structure
- Use case recommendations

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Read Niches**: Reads product categories from `niches.csv`
2. **Validate API Credentials**: Checks that RAPIDAPI_KEY is set (fails if not)
3. **Intelligent Data Gathering** (NEW): Uses multi-source data layer:
   - Scrapes Google Trends for trending products (Puppeteer)
   - Scrapes Amazon Best Sellers for proven products (Puppeteer)
   - Applies premium brand filter (Apple, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, Bang & Olufsen, etc.)
   - Falls back to RapidAPI if < 8 premium products found
   - Returns top 10 products combined from all sources
4. **Save Raw Data**: Stores gathered products in `/data/<niche>.json` for debugging
5. **Validate Response**: Ensures products have required fields (ASIN, title, image)
6. **Generate SEO Content**: Creates optimized content using `generate-seo.js`
7. **Generate Blog Articles**: Creates detailed reviews using `generate-blog.js`
8. **Build Pages**: Compiles templates with product data
9. **Auto-Publish** (Optional): If PAT_TOKEN is configured, publishes each site to its own GitHub repository
10. **Deploy**: GitHub Actions publishes to GitHub Pages

**Error Handling**: If any niche fails (API error, rate limit, no products), the generator:
- Logs the exact error with full details
- Continues processing other niches
- Fails the entire build if ALL niches fail
- Never generates mock or dummy data

## 🚀 Auto-Publishing Feature

When configured with a GitHub Personal Access Token (`GH_PAT`), the generator automatically:

1. **Creates a separate GitHub repository** for each niche site at `https://github.com/SC-Connections/<niche-slug>`
2. **Pushes all site content** to the new repository
3. **Enables GitHub Pages** automatically on the `main` branch
4. **Outputs the public URL** at `https://sc-connections.github.io/<niche-slug>/`

### Benefits:
- ✅ Each niche site has its own dedicated repository
- ✅ Independent version control for each site
- ✅ Separate GitHub Pages URLs for better SEO
- ✅ Easier to manage individual sites
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if token is not configured

### Setup:
Add a fine-grained Personal Access Token with `repo:write` permissions to the `GH_PAT` secret in GitHub Actions settings.

## 🌐 Generated Site Structure

Each niche site includes:

```
/sites/bluetooth-earbuds/
├── index.html           # Main top 10 list page
├── global.css          # Styles
└── blog/
    ├── ASIN1.html      # Product 1 detailed review
    ├── ASIN2.html      # Product 2 detailed review
    └── ...             # Reviews for all 10 products
```

## 📈 GitHub Pages Deployment

The deployment process uses two GitHub Actions workflows:

### 1. Build and Deploy Niche Sites (`build-sites.yml`)
This workflow:
1. Generates all niche sites from `niches.csv`
2. Creates niche folders in the repository root (e.g., `/bluetooth-headphones/`)
3. Commits and pushes the generated folders to the repository
4. Runs on push to main, workflow dispatch, or weekly schedule

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages (`deploy-pages.yml`)
This workflow:
1. Runs AFTER the build workflow completes successfully
2. Validates that all niche folders exist before deployment
3. Generates the root index.html page
4. Uploads and deploys all content to GitHub Pages
5. Can also be manually triggered via workflow dispatch

**Important**: The deploy workflow will FAIL if niche folders are missing. This prevents deploying broken sites with 404 errors.

### Site URLs:
- Main index: `https://sc-connections.github.io/Top-10/`
- Niche sites: `https://sc-connections.github.io/Top-10/<niche-slug>/`
  - Example: `https://sc-connections.github.io/Top-10/bluetooth-headphones/`

### First-Time Setup:
1. Ensure `RAPIDAPI_KEY` secret is configured in repository settings
2. Add at least one niche to `niches.csv`
3. Manually trigger the "Build and Deploy Niche Sites" workflow
4. Wait for it to complete and commit niche folders
5. The deploy workflow will automatically run and deploy to GitHub Pages

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate sites
node site-generator.js

# Sites will be in the sites/ directory
# Open sites/[niche-slug]/index.html in a browser
```

### Important: No Mock Data

**The generator requires valid API credentials and real API data to function.** There is no mock data fallback. If:
- RAPIDAPI_KEY is not configured
- API returns an error or invalid response
- Products are missing required fields (ASIN, title, image, price, rating, reviews, description)

The generator will **fail immediately** and will NOT generate any sites. This ensures that only real, complete product data from Amazon is used in generated sites.
